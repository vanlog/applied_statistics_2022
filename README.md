## Applied Statistics and Big Data Materials


### Download and open the project with RStudio

In RStudio menu: File > "New Project..."

Version Control > Git

In "Repository Url" paste 

    https://github.com/vanlog/applied_statistics_2022.git
    
Select where to download it (to clone) and finish the procedure.


### Update to the latest version

In Rstudio on the "Git" tab press the blue down arrow ("Pull"). If something goes wrong you can try to solve the issue googling the message, or re-clone the repository in another folder.


## Important advice

Please do not modify files in `session_material`, if you need to operate on a file, make a copy outside the `session_material` folder. This is recommended to avoid conflicts in case the teacher update the material.
